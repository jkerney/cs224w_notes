### Define:
Provide definiations of the following:
* Degree
* Eigenvector Centrality
* Betweenness Centrality
* Closeness Centrality
* Clustering Coefficient

### Centrality
* The Degree of nodes A, B, and C
* The Eigenvector Centrality of nodes A, B, C, D, and E. (Use wolphram alpha or numpy to solve the matrix equations)
* The Betweenness Centrality of node E
* The Closeness Centrality of nodes B and C

### Clustering
* The Clustering Coefficient of node E
* Graphlet Degree Vector of node C for Graphlets of Degree 2 or 3

Graphlets of Degree 3:
